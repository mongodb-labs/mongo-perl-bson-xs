library and v0.8.4 is the final patch release.

B<As of August 13, 2020, the MongoDB Perl driver and related libraries have
reached end of life and are no longer supported by MongoDB.> See the
L<August 2019 deprecation
notice|https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/the-mongodb-perl-driver-is-being-deprecated>
for rationale.

If members of the community wish to continue development, they are welcome

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module contains an XS implementation for BSON encoding and
decoding.  There is no public API.  Use the L<BSON> module and it will
choose the best implementation for you.
